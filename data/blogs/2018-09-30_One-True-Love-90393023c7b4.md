# One True Love

She is more than an addiction; She is love.

She is unique, finer than a bisque.

She is bitter, but that’s what makes your life better.

She is the fuel to your brain, Never leaves you in vain.

When the sun hits the ground, She makes sure you’re off the ground.

When things go down-hill, The black beauty makes you brave.

The one who keeps you carefree

Her the name is **_Coffee_**.
