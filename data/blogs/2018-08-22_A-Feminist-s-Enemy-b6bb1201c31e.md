# A Feminist’s Enemy

_From my personal experience_

I didn’t tag myself as a Feminist until recently. The judgmental comments that people pass while expressing my ambitious goals was good enough to keep me mute. For me to follow my dreams as a woman there were a million hurdles, Each with its own set of complexities. The complications were mostly because of people, their ideas and the social structure that feeds those ideas.

### 1\. Me

I grew up with certain norms and conditions. The social structure is built in such a way that they would let the girl build a glass ceiling for herself without even her realization. Most of a woman’s life is spent in breaking this ceiling that she made for herself.

Bound by these norms, there is no real way to get out of them than to break them. That is when your internal resistance kicks in. All those attempts I made to exit it without breaking the rules and hearts ended in failure. The norms and values were so ingrained in me that I started judging myself, made excuses, ensured that you don’t do it. It might be a natural reaction but breaking your inner evil and letting the feminist angel take over is the biggest battle that ever happened in me.

### 2\. Family

Once you break your shell and win the inner battle, you would think life is going to be easy, but it just prepared you for what is going to come next. The reality.

Now with all these new ideas, the brain gets tuned to think differently. You start to act with more power, courage. This would make your parents wonder what changed her. By sharing your visionary ideas and standing up for your beliefs, you would start triggering people’s ego.

They make assumptions that its because you found another support system for life. But they fail to understand that turning into a feminist is a natural reaction like teenage but since there is no defined time frame your world would not be ready for it. This ends up leaving your close ones clueless, and ta-da you triggered peoples egos, and you are the bad one now.

### 3\. Other women

Now that we talked about triggering egos. It makes the women who haven’t broken their ceilings to starts advising to subtle it down. They tag you with all kinds of words to your character.

Thinking that the whole point of feminism is standing up for your right and respect at every instant. You subscribe yourself into a cyclic reaction of misogynistic advises and curse words followed by your defense. I learned the hard way by getting myself into one such cyclic response that the only person I am answerable to is myself.

As a feminist, it is important that you pick your battles. When someone gives you misogynistic advice don’t take it, walk away, run for your life. It is not your job to educate them. Instead fight the battles that are really worth it, will bring a change.

### 4\. Men

Men, the population that gets offended the moment I use the word feminism. The battles I had with men are much lesser than the ones I had with women. Just how I was fed with values and norms, men are also fed with certain ideas. One such idea is misogyny. The constant boasting of men being better than women had built up their ego. Now that we have touched enough number of men’s ego in my life. I learned how to peep under it and reason with them.

### 5\. Society

This is the most ambiguous part of the crowd. Most of the times I didn't know what to expect. Every day I face new challenges and I slash it off as I come across it.  
Starting from what to wear to the way I walk, speak laugh, the society has restrictions on everything I do.

### 6\. World

So far what I covered was very personalized to what I had faced in my life. It is all built upon my belief system and experiences. Every religion, region, country faces a different set of problems. Why go that far? The methods that had helped me go through all these might not work for the girl next to me. The ingrained habit of looking at the world through our experience is another enemy I am fighting with.
