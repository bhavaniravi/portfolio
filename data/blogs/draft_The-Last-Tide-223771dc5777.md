## The Last Tide

The last tide for the year has visited

Just like all the times

It was no different

Wait there was one

This time I took it for granted

What was I thinking?

I thought it will pardon me just once

What was I thinking?

I thought it will go easy on me

But nothing changed

Just like every other time

It showed no mercy on me

Just like every other time

There were groan and pain

Just like every other time

There was a stirred up brain and sinful thoughts
