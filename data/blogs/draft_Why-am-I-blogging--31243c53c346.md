## Why am I blogging?

Back in 2010 when I started coding no one asked me this question? The question didn’t pop up until started talking about it. Now that I am not just writing but also publishing blogs. The question started popping up again.

To be honest, I don’t have an answer to it. I started coding because I liked what it did to my brain. I have the same effect when I write something. I see both programming and writing as a way of expressing the thoughts.

I didn’t know If I could make money out of my coding skills but I kept doing it for the love of it. Similarly, i will be writing for a period of time without thinking about what kind of benefits it could reap.
