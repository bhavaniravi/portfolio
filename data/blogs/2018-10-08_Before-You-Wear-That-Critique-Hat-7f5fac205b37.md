# Before You Wear That Critique Hat

People judge. I was not an exception. We are culturally trained to comment on things that happen in front of us. My most common one is, _“How dumb can a person be to drive that slow?”_ In my defense under-speed is a thing and it irritates me. Coming back to the point, we are all bound to pass some comments on things, and I was no different until one day…

## The Signal and the Song

I was standing at the Tidel park signal, and something drew my attention. It was a song from the junction. I was trying to find out where it was coming from, and every revelation triggered a million critical comments. Here is how it goes.

For a second, I thought, it was some auto-wala with a loudspeaker. _“Why would an auto-wala have such a poor speaker?”, “He is not going to get a booking with that kind of sound.”_

Before I could pass on the next comment, I figured that it was a blind person singing on the pavement. I sharpened my hearing skill actually to listen to what he was singing. The tune was familiar to me but couldn’t make out the song. Now I felt bad for the guy since his singing skills are not reflected well by the speaker.

As I leaned in further, it was _“_[_en pirandhai maganae_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSD1juEt_eY)_,” an old sad Tamil_ song. A moment later the inner me went something like, _“Why would he sing such a depressing song?”,_ _“Maybe he should sing something more fun and entertaining it would attract more people.”_

The _cruel me_ kept on making these comments, and suddenly the sane part of my brain took over. The next thought rushed up contradicting the previous one. It went exactly like this, “_Well, Shut up dude, the very fact that you are making these comments is because he already grabbed your attention. For him, that’s a mission accomplished.”_ That was a moment of realization for me.

## The Bigger Picture

The biggest drawback of humans is that they can perceive the world only from their view or experience. This characteristic often blinds our reasoning.

A lot of times in our lives, we often become critiques of the situation, without giving it much thought. But when we take a step back and look at it carefully, it would have solved the purpose. The fact that he is blind and singing a sad song had earned my sympathy, and that was what he was looking for. Think of a blind man with the best speaker and a golden voice. The chances are that you might try making him an Arjith Singh rather than giving him 10 rupees.

Let’s take the IRCTC website for example. We all would have cursed the pain of booking train tickets on IRCTC. But in reality, IRCTC doesn’t need to give its users a feel-good experience like Facebook or Twitter. It already has enough traffic.
