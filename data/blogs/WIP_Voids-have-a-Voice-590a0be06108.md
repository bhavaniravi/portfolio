# Voids have aÂ Voice

Love is overrated, So is hate.

Before I could fit you in that grey spot, I lost you to my fate.

With the ripples of your warmth, creating a crack in my soul.

The muses of your heart, becoming the curse of my life.

The void that you left, creating a canvas out of my heart.

The voices of your dreams, treasuring of my spirit.

## Random Crap

In your head we dwell

As we break open our shell
