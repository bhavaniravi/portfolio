## Machine Learning — NLP Vectorization Techniques

Whenever you start with any ML algorithm that involves text you should convert the text into a bunch of numbers. This is obvious because ML algorithms usually build a probabilistic model(which is math) and math can deal only with numbers.

> The process of converting NLP text into numbers is called vectorization in machine learning.

### Word Vocabulary

Vocabulary is the list of all the words you are dealing with. If your dataset can contain 1000 documents then your word vocabulary would be a list of unique words from the document. For a generalized chatbot, your vocabulary will have all the words in the language dictionary. For a customer success bot, it will have a language understanding as well as the words with respect to the products or services you provide.
