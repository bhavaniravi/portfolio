# What's stopping you from being fit and How to overcome it?

We all want to stay fit and healthy. But somehow that motivation is not working the magic for us. We as human needs just more than healthy and good looking body. James Clear, in atomic habits suggests that habits such as hitting the gym are not rewarding to humans because we live in a world on instant gratification. But habits like fitness, meditation, reading will take sometime to reach momentum and reap benifits.

I was in your shoes for past 2 years. I was a fitness freak when I was in college. But after I got my LASIK(story for another time) I was told not to do heavy workouts for atleast an year. By the time I got the green signal from my eye doctor I became super lazy to continue my fitness regime. This is pretty common for people who go through surgery and accidents but getting back on the path of fitness is hectic.

So that was my reason, yours can be any of the following
1. Not having time - A totally valid reason, I travel 3 hrs for my previous job, I barely had time to move around let alone fitness.

2. It's not working for you - You tried a million things but you are not shedding calories? - You are doing it wrong. You need to consult a trainer and get help.

3. It's painful - I agree it is. But the pain won't stick around for long.

4. I am a Mother/Father - Great, snatch those mobile phones from your kids and start running around with them. 

## Why is it important?

### Health

Who doesn’t want an healthy life? Want to be active, fit, healthy and happy even when you are 60. 

### The Compound Effect.
I will do it from tomorrow. No you will not. The more you procastinate the more pounds you are going to carry in your body. The more weight you put on the more time and effort you have to put in to lose that weight.

For eg., Imagine you are obese just by 2 kgs. With a bit of diet and fitness routine of 20 minutes a day you can shed it off easily. Now imagine loosing 20kgs. You have no other go but to follow a very strict diet, Hit the gym more or may be a bootcamp. 

The procastination is only going to cost you more time for your future self.

### The pain feels AMAZINGGG!!

Don't even get me started on the amount of health issues I was going through the whole year. I was constantly sick, My immunity was low. I was anemic, I felt no motivation towards life, constantly stressed and depressed.

So the pain was actually a pleasure for me. Provided all the above symptoms vanished.

Also here is another thing to note, do proper warm ups and cool downs to have less pain or cramps. Those 10 minute super fast videos will make you cry in pain(Been there done that)

### The real Stress Buster

A sound mind reflects a sound body and the vice versa is also true. Feeling down? Hit those 10 pushups and your confidence level actually increases. Fix your body you can actually fix anything in this world

### It’s not just physical strength
