# A World Where WomenInTech Leads
_What are the socital changes an empowered womenintech will bring_

I was at Google's #ICS2019 over the last weekend. ICS2019 is an annual conference for all GDG, WTM and GDGC leads from all over India. It is a space for us to meet, collaborate and share ideas. You can imagine it as a meetup for people who conduct meetups. On the 2nd day of the summit we had a special workshop for womentechmakers leaders. As a part of the workshop we were asked to brainstrom on an ideal world where womenintech are paid and treated equally where we don't have to struggle for what we deserve. We were split into team of 6 and started brainstroming. I asusaul had things flowing. I changed everything that bothers me and made it a part of my imaginery world. I am going to list them down and help you visualize those for the rest of the blog.

### Public Restrooms

Imagine your fellow colleague leaving for the day, unlike other chennai days it was raining and she was drenched. The cool wind adds up the suituation and she starts shaking and wants to pee. Where will she go? As men it is so easy for you to find a corner on the road and do your business but seriously where will we go? 

In my imaginery world where women thrive there will be well equipped clean public restrooms around the city. We would not have to shut our water intake inorder to shut the exit.

 As men you can help us. Everytime you use a public space trains, transport offices, restaurants, schools, temples make sure the restrooms are clean. Don't give zomanto or Redbus rating just for their food or travel. 


### Work Life Balance

Why do you have to go home early? You are not even married? I have heard many female complain about this. I vouched that if I ever manage a team I will make it a rule for men to leave early to spend time with kids to help their wife with household chores. 

In a women built world we don't have to fight our way into work life balance because it is just the way of life

### Domestic Work Gets Paid

Imagine a world, where domestic work is paid. Washing dishes, clothes, cleaning house and so on. It gets paid so much that men might even fight that they would take care of all the chores. We are still talking about an imaginery not ideal world.

### Chairs to Cars

In a world designed for women, we don't have to work in a station build for men's average height. We no longer have to travel in buses with handles that are far ahead of our reach. We can be sure that the cars we drive are safe for us because it is [tested with dummies of female skeleton.](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/23/truth-world-built-for-men-car-crashes)
