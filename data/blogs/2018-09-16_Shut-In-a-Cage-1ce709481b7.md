# Shut In a Cage

<figure>

</figure>

Shut in a cage, Yet I am flying.

May be in my head, May be in my heart.

That’s what keeps me alive.

Million souls around, Yet I feel alone.

Hugs cure em a bit, Not all of em.

Songs cure em a bit, Not all of em.

Writing cures em a bit, Not all of em.

May be there is no cure,

May be there is no cage,

May be the only thing that holds me down is me.

May be I need to push a bit harder,

To crack it open and fly… For real.
