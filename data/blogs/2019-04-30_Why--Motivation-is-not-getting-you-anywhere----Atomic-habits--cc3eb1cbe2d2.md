## Why Motivation is Not Getting You Anywhere — Atomic Habits

Focus On the Start, Not the End.

### Motivation is not enough

It sounds like the universal truth. You might be nodding your head right now. Most of us are motivated to accomplish something but are also the masters of procrastinating things forever. Understanding why this happens was a huge revelation for me.

Motivation gives you a sense of accomplishment. Feeling pumped about something feels like you are on the right track and you are actually doing something great with your life. But, what you are actually doing is watching GoT. Though you feel shitty at the end of it, the anticipation that you will work on something great tomorrow will feed the sense of accomplishment right back into your brain. Hence, you are stuck in the never-ending loop of

> Motivation -> Sense of Accomplishment -> Procrastination

The second huge revelation was that we often feel motivated because we are excited about the end result. I will become a great writer, an amazing artist, a sophisticated software engineer, etc., but how many of us are excited about writing that first chapter of the book, painting that first stroke, writing that first line of code.

In the excitement of reaping the benefits, we often forget to see the road that will take us there. The change of perception to look at motivation as a start of something is truly great.
