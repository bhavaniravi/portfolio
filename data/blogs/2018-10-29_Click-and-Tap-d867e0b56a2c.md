## Click and Tap

A new age dance show

A dance show with ten people.

No salsa or waltz could match this

The music goes something like click-click-click and tap.

So do the dancer’s steps

Each tap paints a picture in front of you

A picture of your brain

A part of your heart

A vision of your dreams

A version of you.

A dance that goes click and tap

It’s your fingers over the **keypad**
