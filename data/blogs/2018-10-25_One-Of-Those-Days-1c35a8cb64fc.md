## One Of Those Days

One of those days, where you can’t afford to fall sick.

One of those days, where you have to stand up when your world goes downhill.

One of those days, Where you’re dressed up, but depressed

One of those days, where you put that smile on when your soul is stressed.

One of those days, where you have to walk chin up, through the cracked paths.

One of those days, where you have to keep going,

Through the cracked lands,

Through the deep gashes,

Through the broken pieces,

until it becomes

One of those days, where you can parade through your problems.
