# Speak Up. But First Speak.

Why should you speak up?

Remember the first day I played TT and no one was up to tell me the rules. They were clearly not comfortable but at the same time not comfortable to express as well. As someone who is good at facial cues they told me you have to take turns in hitting the ball when you play in pairs.

Similarly, when someone enters your organization there are few explicit things that the new ones can pick up for eg., where to get coffee or where is the restroom or lunch place. But what’s hard is to understand communicate the work ethic, culture and the team’s expectation from you. These are just like the TT rules, The rules that you have to play by when working as a team. 

Hence it is important to voice these unwritten rules, that leaving a million cues for them to pick up
