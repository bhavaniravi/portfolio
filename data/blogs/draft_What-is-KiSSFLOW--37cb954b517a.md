## What is KiSSFLOW?

Automate Work and Reduce Chaos

I started working for KiSSFLOW 7 months back. Outside of my work, I tech meetups. Every time I conduct an event and people ask me about the KiSSFLOW I immediately go like _“It is a BPM software to automate workflows”._ The listener's eyes widen as they hear the word “automate” but they give me a blank stare as I finish the sentence. I was pretty sure that they didn’t understand any of it. I knew I had to fine tune it.

Recently, our writer’s workshop mate [Paval](https://medium.com/u/3ee99d5a26ae) wrote an article about speaking customer’s language. I kept the thought process running on how to apply those techniques to give a better intro for myself and for the product.

## Do you apply Leave?

It doesn’t matter what category you belong to. Do you apply for your leave? Usually, you will have a form that you need to fill before or after taking the leave. If your management lives in the stone age you might have to fill a printed form. Sometimes it is all tracked in an Email thread and it is the job of the operations team to go through the junk and get the data out.

Now, what if I tell you, your management can setup KiSSFLOW and you can apply leaves in a couple of clicks. 

## How Does it Differ from a Google Form?

I can very well achieve that in a [Google](https://medium.com/u/991272e72e68) form. I hear you saying that. But what happens when you submit a Google form. You get a confirmation mail and the data is fed into a spreadsheet.

Google forms work the best for data collection, but what if you want to perform operations with it? 

This is where the automation part of workflows kicks in. What if your manager gets an alert immediately after you submit the request? He will have options to approve or deny the request.

> I can hire an intern to build it for me

> This sounds like my college project

  

  

  

If you’re a student from Engineering colleges in TamilNadu, my job is so easy because I exactly know how the system works. Even if not you will have one of these following systems in place. Let’s look through the processes you have in your college and how you can use KiSSFLOW to automate this mundane task.

### OD/No due/Leave Form

How many times have you filled one of those above forms and ran behind teachers across different departments? Especially during those critical times when you have an internal exam or a semester ahead. For a few professors, this is the time for them to show who has the power?

Now let’s come back to KiSSFLOW. If your college management one fine day wakes up to the reality and realizes that they are wasting students time and decided to use KiSSFLOW to automate the above process. All you will be doing is, opening the KiSSFLOW app, initiate the respective No due or Leave form, with information life days, or no of classes, the reason etc., and on submission, it will be sent to your class in charge and travels through the hierarchy to the HOD and reaches you back with an Approval or Rejection.
