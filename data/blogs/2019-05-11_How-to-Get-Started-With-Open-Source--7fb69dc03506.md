# How to Get Started With Open Source?

With a video walkthrough where I actually make a PR.

1.  Pick a Problem
2.  Solve that Problem using open source
3.  Be the critique and find fault in the system.
4.  Don’t bad mouth, just raise issues
5.  Offer to fix them
6.  Give the fix and collaborate with them on making it better
7.  Pray all gods, and hope your fix gets merged.

Watch the tutorial video, where I walk you through how to pick a problem and actually solve it and give a pull request.
