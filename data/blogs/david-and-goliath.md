# David & Goliath
## The underdogs, misfits and the art of battling giants

David and Goliath is the 3rd book I read in 2020. I am a big fan of Malcolm Gladwell, especially because of the way he questions the obvious. Be it Outliers or Talking to strangers, he makes us look at the world the way we would have never thought of before. 

## What I liked about this book?

From the time I got the book, to writing this book I was thinking it was *David vs Goliath*, but It wasn't until I resided to write this reflection I realized it was *David and goliath* and that changes a lot of things. It was never about the fight, It was not about the battle, It was about how we all have our strengths and weaknesses. How we can use them to our advantage to get our way through this world. How nice would it be if we stop tagging and judging people? Of course in sports, someone has to lose so that someone has to win, but it life? 

The world is filled with David's and goliath's, neither weak neither strong, trying to co-exist in their own inner battles.

## Big Takeaways

Went too philosophical there, didn't I? 

Unlike the 1st two books I read Atomic habits and 7 habits, this book is not a self-help book, not a practical guide that would change your life, It is a book filled with case studies to prove that our conventional ideas can be questioned and proved wrong. But here are the 3 broad ideas.


## Question the Conventional Wisdom

For those of you who don't know the David and Goliath Story, *goliath* challenges <army_name> for single combat. To send one of their mightiest warriors. No one came forward looking at the stance of *goliath* with this threatening figure and armor, except *David*. David is a shepherd boy who comes forward to fight *goliath*. David refuses to use any of the weapons offered by the army. He resided with his slingshot. As David ran towards Goliath, the overconfident Goliath calls out saying *"“Am I a dog, that you come at me with sticks?”"*. Despite all that David shoots a pebble at the giant's head to make him fall dead. Conventional wisdom communicates it as a mighty shepherd boy fighting and defeating a giant, just by using his courage.

The book begins by questioning the takeaway from that story. 
- Was goliath really powerful as he looked?
- Was it just the courage that made David come forward?
- How could a stone in a slingshot make a person drop dead?

On asking these questions the missing pieces of the story come to light.

> Was goliath really powerful as he looked?

Goliath is not as powerful as he looked, He was giant because he had a hormonal imbalance. During 
the battle, he asks the opponent to come to him conventional wisdom might tell you that it is an expression of power in reality he couldn't move due to the heavy armor. When David approached Goliath with the slingshot, he thought it was a stick. Either he is overconfident or He has eye problems to due to his hormonal imbalance

> Was it just the courage that made David come forward?

Maybe David looked beyond Goliath's demeanor. On looking at Goliath covered in his armor, maybe he got reminded of the Dartboard he was using to practice slingshots during his free time.

> How could a stone in a slingshot make a person drop dead?

David didn't just sling the shot, he was running towards Goliath while spinning the sling. The stone had enough velocity to make the giant fall, his weight took care of the dropping dead part.

When history presents itself don't run with it, look at it from perspectives others have missed. That's the theory every Malcolm Gladwell's book is based on.

### Disadvantage in Advantages

On the first look, everyone who is against Goliath might look like they are at a disadvantage until David looked past it. With this body, covered with armor, mighty sword all could have looked like an advantage, but in reality,those were the reasons behind Goliath's defeat.

Here is another example, Even the brightest students feel like they are not good enough on joining a prestigious institution. What should have played as an advantage, being around the best students, teachers, access to the best resources should have worked as to their advantage instead in most cases it hits their confidence, makes them question their intellect.

### Advantage In Disadvantages

Whatconventional wisdom calls a disadvantage often plays out as an advantage. Don't you think? We all know that blind people have high sensory capabilities than non-blind. I defer to call them normal becausethere is no normal. Everyone has their advantages and disadvantages.

The
 book states that dyslexics have the advantage of winning over people as
 they develop coping mechanisms to get along with others in a normal 
way. From arguing their way around at school to get better grades to 
becoming a lawyer.

### Play your Game

The third idea is all about *playing by your strengths* even if it looked stupid. One look at David people would have laughed at him, called him stupid but none of that stopped him. He knew what his strengths are. He didn't opt to use any weapons offered by the army, because he knew he was not good at it.

When a situation presents itself, look at your options, Look beyond the conventional wisdom. *By putting out advantage, we hide our disadvantage.*
