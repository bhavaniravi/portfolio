## Voids have a Voice

Love is overrated

So is hate,

Before I could fit you in that grey spot

I lost you to my fate.

The ripples of warmth, 

Is creating a crack in my soul.

The muses of the master,

Is becoming a curse

For the void that people leave in your life

becomes the memories of your soul.

For the voices of people living in your head

becomes the treasure of your spirit.

  

## Random Crap

In your head we dwell

As we break open our shell
