# Why Should you Attend Tech Conferences?

_Learning multiples when a number of brain comes together in the name of Conferences, Meetups, and Communities_

## Learning 

A tech conference overloads your brain with a large about of data in a short amount of time. This means that you will be introduced to wide set of technologies and how they are used in the industry. 

**Gotchas:** Lot of times people might feel "insecure" about they don't know much when attending a confernce, but here is what you need to understand. The very reason conferences are happening is to introduce you to the technology. Tell me one thing why would you take a course if you already know everything about it.

The major takeaway for me from conferences are what's mentioned in this blog, and a notepad full of words I don't understand for me to go back and understand what it is.

## Meeting Cool People

Conferences unlike meetups are focused on a broader topic. As a classic example PyCon covers Python at every angle not just industry but also education, research and so on. Which means you get to meet not just hardcore techies but also people who put tech to good use in core domains like finance, pubishing etc.,

## Jobs, Internships

Trust me, People in a conference are always hunting for cool people to work with. So if you are looking for cool opportunity to work with hangout with as many people from the other category and trust me you will land a great job. Atleast it would make your next job hunt much easier.

## Motivation

At this point, you are going to give me reasons like, Oh I am just a beginner, But I don't have much expertise to even talk to the above set of people. They know so much. I understand. I was there where you are now. 

This is when the sense of community kicks in. 99% of the people in the conference are there for the community. They are there to impart and update their wisdom. So don't be afraid to even ask the dumbest question. 

**Gotcha:** When someone make you feel low, or laugh at you for not knowing this. Walk up to one of the organizers or volunteers and file a complaint. They need to blacklisted for such behavior. It is a norm in most communities.

## Friends

Alot of people. With similar mindest. Mostly developers, dealing with same kind of issues you are facing everyday. Would understand all those comics about deleting production DBs. Would there be a better setup to create lasting friendship? I got great friends out of conferences. You will too.

**Gotchas:** Be adults, don't hit on people. That's not how you make friends and it's not the right setup. May be do it after the conference.

## Swags

Who doesn't love a cool T-shirt with a kickass saying like _It works on my machine._ It is always a nice feeling to conference swags. Not sure why. Not a big fan of stickers tough, so you can have mine too.

## Great Food

Conference organizers takes a big effort in providing good food for the attendees, so the amount you pay will be worth it.

## It's Worth the Money

Last but not the least, conference may cost you. But it is always worth to pay that money because it is completely paid back to you in the form of 
1.  Knowledge
2. Connections
3. Good Food
4. Last but not the least - The Experience


My conferences have always been Pycon India and local ones from Python Hyderabad and Delhi. I can vouch for their quality, the sense of community and the effort they put to create a inclusive environment.
