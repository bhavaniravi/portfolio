# The Endless

> Let's not love.  
> Let's not hate.

> Let's walk around,  
> Letting the fate decide.

> Let's lose track,  
> Let's meet again.

> Let's fill the heart with melodies.  
> Let's fill our dairies with memories.

> Let's be the pros,  
> keeping our woes.

> Let's be the parallel lines  
> that never meets nor part ways.
