100 Days to be specific. That’s the amount of time to get expertise in any technology.

## Course Format

The course will be taken by a small group of 4–5 people which means special focus to each one of you. The 5 people will actually work as a **_remote software team._**

1.  Introductions and getting to know your team
2.  We will kickstart with a weekend hack, setting goals and expectations and workflow for the next 3 months
3.  Hands-on walkthrough on how to build a to-do app(this will give you a wholesome experience of what you will be building for the next 3 months)
4.  Define goals for the week and start working remotely for the rest of the week(2 hours/day on weekdays).
5.  Learn over a weekend, hack throughout the week with specific mentorship.

## Stack covered

1.  Backend — Python (Flask & Django) 
2.  Frontend — Html, CSS, JS ReactJs — Frontend
3.  Databases — MySQL
4.  Orchestration — Docker, Kubernetes
5.  Cloud — Digitalocean, AWS

## How much does it cost? — Rs.25,000

We will be spending most of this money to get a place for our weekend hack and Pizzas.

## How does it better from other courses?

1.  You will be actually building industry style applications
2.  You will be working with a real team
3.  You will be following best practices that the industry follows.

The main idea is to _get you as close as possible to the industry._

## Is there a Certificate?

No. You will have something better than that. **A developer profile. What else can prove that you know code than the code itself? Yes, you will have a developer profile at the end of the course.**
