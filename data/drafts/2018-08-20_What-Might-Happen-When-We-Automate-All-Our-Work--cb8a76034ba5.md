# What Might Happen When We Automate All Our Work?

Have you ever imagined a world where things get done for you rather than having to do it yourself? You might be like, _“I am already in a world like that. My father/mother/wife does everything for me.”_ Or you’re on the other side of the spectrum who does these things, you may be like _“Yeah, I would love that world.”_ The real question is, will we love living in a world like that? I thought about it a bit more, and I found that I couldn’t relate. Here’s why.

### The Trigger

It first happened when one of my friends got an Amazon package and left a huge box on the table. I was super pissed, since I like my workplace clean. When I expressed it to my friend, another friend of mine started supporting the first friend’s act, saying that if he disposes the package in the office it would contribute to common trash instead of each of us throwing out our own. I could see where that was coming from.

The week before, we went to another IT park where we admired a green disposal system. She said having a common disposal system like that would reduce waste. She expanded the idea from a disposal system to automating mundane activities like cooking, cleaning etc., so people could just focus on their career. I was nodding along without a comment. For me, It was not one of those things that immediately clicked.

### The After Effects

My thoughts rippled When I drove back home. I started chewing on the same idea and let my imagination take me for a ride. In a completely automated world, where your workplace takes care of everything like walking your dog, Feeding your kid, etc., what would there be left for you to do? Just work? or would you just spend your time watching movies or traveling?

If that kind of a system comes into place, we would be breaking the structure of families. All of us would become a person whose tasks are done by companies. The only price we pay is the actual work we get done.

How could that possibly work?!

I have seen documentaries where people in China rent a place just to spend a night. There won’t be a concept of a house. It’ll just be a bunch of glorified We will just have a bunch of glorified Airbnb’s.

Everyone has their own idea of what life is supposed to be. At the same time, we’re all required to come to a common ground for the sake of society. If society is automated, It would break the concept of living as groups.

In the process of evolution, we built up a system that made us focus on our own selves before others. We forgot to live together in harmony, capitalizing on each others strengths and working on weaknesses. We don’t think for people around us. This constant denial to be what we are forces us to prove our superiority over others and makes us hold regrets. All this pressure pushes us to think that living life alone would be the right solution.

Is that really the case? In my mind, it feels like complete and utter chaos. What do you think about it?
