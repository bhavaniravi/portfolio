# It’s Okay.

_Sometimes it’s Ok to do things that are not Ok._

<figure>

</figure>

It is not ok to take someone for granted

It is not ok to disrespect someone

It is not ok to hit someone

It is not ok to hurt someone

It is not ok to judge someone

It is not ok to stab someone with words

It is not ok to offend someone

but,

Sometimes it’s Ok to do things that are not Ok.

When your hair is held back not by a ponytail

When your cheeks are red not because of a blush

When a cigar drills through your hands

When your uterus is kicked out of your stomach

When you are stabbed at the heart, not by cupid arrow

When you are drained not because of a long day of work
