Hit rock bottom, You will find some Diamonds.

Even after the gashes and scratches, You will find some power to stand up.

Even when the things go downhill, It will streak up your will.

No, it’s not a choice you made, but that does not voice your fate.

First N steps are not gonna be new,

With a few more you are gonna find your clue

From there,

No matter how much you fall,

You know how to stand up

Because you have already hit rock bottom.
